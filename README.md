Uniswag is a Google Chrome extension developed to overcome some quirks of my university course management system.

Features:
- [Export course assignments to Todoist.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622989/39090164-c5abaa9a-459c-11e8-9a09-6993a7e416be.gif)
- [Folder creation in Google Drive for every course.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622989/39090166-d79e6684-459c-11e8-8a31-a0e0514fc083.gif)
- Saves your enrollment so you don't have to type it every time you want to log in.
- Keyboard shortcut.

## How to use:
1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uniswag/mogfppbobkadpdmpjdpcgmajlcffiemn)
2. Navigate to either your schedule or your course page.
3. There should be a button (_Crear carpetas en Drive_ or _Exportar a Todoist_).
4. Click on that button.
5. The app should ask for permissions.
6. Allow permissions.
7. The app should redirect you either to your Google Drive or your Todoist and you should see the newly created items.
